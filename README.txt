CRASHRACER by pistillphil

You drive through a desert with high velocity, because you flee! (Does not matter from what)
Avoid Obstacles!
The longer you play the faster the score will rise and the harder survival will be.
For every PowerUp you collect your score will climb faster.
You can activate EVERY powerUp at once. You loose the improved scoreRate, but you will be invincible for about 3 seconds. So you should really think twice about when to use powerUps!

Controls:
A:		Move Left
D:		Move Right 
Space:		Use PowerUps

M:	Mute/UnMute Music
